# Artificial Intelligence in financial risk management
	

	Final project for the Building AI course
	

	## Summary
	

	This project's goal is to provide a tool, that would allow for easier and better assessment of the financial risk. When it comes to risk management, people (or in this 	case investors, to be more precise) often tend to (for example) overestimate possible events with very big impact on the price of asset, yet with very low probability of 	  happening. At the same time they often underestimate possible events with small impact on the price of asset, yet with very high probability of happening and/or possible 	    multiple occurance, effectively affecting an asset the same amout as the low probability event.
	

	

	## Background
	

	Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
	

	This is how you make a list, if you need one:
	* problem 1
	* problem 2
	* etc.
	

	

	## How is it used?
	

	Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?
	

	This is how you create code examples:
	```
	def main():
	   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
	   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
	   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]
	

	   totPop = sum(pop)
	   totFish = sum(fishers)
	

	   # write your solution here
	

	   for i in range(len(countries)):
	      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%
	

	main()
	```
	

	

	## Data sources and AI methods
	Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
	If you need to use links, here's an example:
	[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)
	

	| Syntax      | Description |
	| ----------- | ----------- |
	| Header      | Title       |
	| Paragraph   | Text        |
	

	## Challenges
	

	What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
	

	## What next?
	

	Data gathering, building a simple model for first tests and looking where it goes!
